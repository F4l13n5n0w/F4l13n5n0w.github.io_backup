Hi, I am F4l13n5n0w, a Junior Pen Tester based in Melbourne. Graduated from RMIT. 

Since I love Infosec and Pen testing, I spend lots of spare time on testing systems and webapps. However, I always keep some time for reading and going outdoor. I love to observe and enjoy the beautiful world and capture it in photos. 

I got my very first Pen testing certificate `OSCP` in Apr. 2015, which I also got the giggles for the whole night :PPP
